Page Name: Zinedin's Website Resume
Description:
	First off, the header section of the website resume has a navigation bar, which acts as a shortcut for users to gain quicker access over each. 
    Category (about education, work, skills, contact). There is also a picture of me to act as a profile picture with my first and last name above that in big font,
    then below my profile picture is the major I'm studying in with my Gmail, which, if clicked, will direct you to send me an email. The main objective of the header 
	section is to act as a big introduction starter. Then below that is the about me section, which contains three short paragraphs about me in general and what I've 
	done so far in my computer science degree. The objective of the about me section is to give future employers an idea of who I'm as an individual when it comes to 
	my personality and character.The third section is the education section which displays a history of my education which are receiving a highschool diploma from 
	Steamboat Springs High School in June of 2018. And also how I'm in progress of getting my bachelor's degree in computer science and expected to graduate in 
	Spring 2021. I sounded the in-progress work with a box to make it stick out in the education section. The objective of this section was to show my education 
	history towards employers. The fourth section is a history of my work experience with the job title being in a bigger and bolder font and the company and 
	description below it being in a smaller font.The reason behind that was because I thought the job position should stick out more so that employers can 
	easily view my past job titles that might interest them. The fifth section is the skills section, which has a table displaying all the skills I've obtained 
	that are helpful within the technology industry in general. The reason why I decided to form the information in a table format is that I just wanted to try out 
	a different method of organizing this kind of information that doesn't involve bullet points. The sixth section is the projects section, which has three of my 
	proudest projects in bold, big font, and if the user clicks on the download statement, it will download the zip files. And then below the downloads is a button 
	with an arrow hover animation that will guide the user to my GitHub repository account. Then comes the final section, which is the contact section, which involves 
	my Gmail, which, if clicked, will direct you to send me an email. Below is the address of the current place I'm living at, and below that is my phone number. 
	Then to the right of that information are the social links that contain the LinkedIn icon and GitHub icon, which, if clicked, will guide you to LinkedIn and 
	Github account. Also, when the user scrolls through the website, there will be a red button on the bottom right corner, which, if clicked, will automatically 
	transition the site to the very top. And finally I hope that the color scheme looks professional and that the colors complement one another.
